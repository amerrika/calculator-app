# Frontend Mentor - Calculator app solution

This is my solution to the [Calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29).

## The Challenge
Your users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference

## Extra Challenge
- I created simple custom favicon for this project with Inkscape.

## What I learned
- CSS clump() function is very useful for setting gap & width of an element. I used it to set width and grid-gap for my buttons-wrapper so there was no need to use media queries.

## Acknowledgments

I got inspiration for this solution from https://github.com/saadman-galib/vue-calculator-app/tree/master
