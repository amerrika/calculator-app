# Frontend Mentor - Calculator app solution

This is my solution to the [Calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29).

## The Challenge
Your users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference

## Extra Challenge
- I created simple custom favicon for this project with Inkscape.

## Acknowledgments
